      <p><b>There's no one right way to make Salisbury steak.
        The basic recipe is super-simple:
        seasoned ground beef patties, 
        browned in a skillet, and served with a gravy,
         often a mushroom-based gravy.
          But there are so many subtle variations on the theme. 
          Here we've picked some of our favorite takes on Salisbury steaks. 
          These  cover all the savory bases,
           highlighting a variety of seasoning options and cooking methods,

             savory gravy -- so don't forget the mashed potatoes on the side!
              Here's how to make Salisbury steak.</b></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
          <li>⅓ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
          <li>¼ cup chopped onions</li>
          <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
          <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons cornst</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until evenly mixed. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick.</p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth, onion, and mushrooms; bring to a boil.

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Bring onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook and stir until onion gravy is thickened, about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve.</p>
